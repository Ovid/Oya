Note: I see you can use User Defined Functions in ClickHouse to fetch the embeddings directly from within ClickHouse. That might simplify the architecture when inserting/updating documents. I haven't looked into it, so I don't know if that's a good idea or not.

Hello @Curtis Poe. Hope you're doing well.
sending diagram represents a high-level architecture of this system.
It outlines the main components, data flows, orchestration logic, and control layers, focusing on security, governance, observability, and integrations rather than implementation-level details.
We would appreciate your review and feedback on the overall design, assumptions, and component boundaries, including any risks, gaps, or suggested improvements before moving into implementation.
